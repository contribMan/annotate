# annotate
ReactJS tool for highlighting text üìù (to help create annotations üí≠) 

## Getting Started 
This is a WIP. I am trying to create a tool that can help me get information when highlight/selecting text. 

## Goal

* Create a component that we can wrap around text that we want to *annotate*

```jsx
<Wrapper>
  <p>The enemy soldiers repidly run towards the fort's entrance.</p>
  <p className="extra-bold">Kotha Singh and Madan Singh embody fortitude and fire their guns towards them.</p>
</Wrapper>
```
* When a piece of text is selected in the `Wrapper` child, we should be get back some important information: `selectedText`, `startIdx`, `endIdx`, `anchorNode`, etc.
* Optional argument to highlight the text (like with CSS)
